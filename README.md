## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> Data source: For this work we will be using a dummy dataset, build by Data Science Academy.

Our job will be to check if two of the variables (both categorical) are related and impact the general information available in the dataset. We will apply a statistical test indicated for categorical variables, the Chi-Square Test.

## Solution Strategy
For that, I used RStudio.
* Step 01: Collecting the Data and Unsdertand the data;
* Step 02: Defining the hypotheses;
* Step 03: Question.


## Next Steps
* Improve the parameters.
* Understand the correlation between variables.

## Disclaimer 
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning course (part of the Data Scientist training)
